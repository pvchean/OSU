#Chemistry 
### Definitions
- **Physical Properties** can be measured without changing the substance chemically.
* **Chemical Properties** can *only* be observed if  the substance is changed into another property.
* **Intensive Properties** don't depend on the amount of substance, e.g. boiling point, density or color.
* **Extensive Properties** depend on the amount of substance, e.g. mass, volume, energy.


**Naming Ionic Compounds**
1) Cations
	- If the cation can have  more than 1 state of charge, we use roman numerals.
		- $Fe^{2+}$ is written as iron(II)
		- $Cr^{3+}$ is written as chromium(III)
2) Anions
	- For **monatomic** anions derived from anions  the ending changes to -ide,
		- Cl$^-$ becomes chloride
	- For **polyatomic** anions name isn't changed, e.g. Dichloride, trichloride, etc.
3) Cations are written before Anions

what ends in -ate?
second row: Nitrate ($NO_3$), Carbonate ($CO_{3}$), Fluorate $FO_{3}$
third row: Aluminate($AlO_{4}$), Phosphate ($PO_4$), Sulfate ($SO_4$)
	Only exception being Clorate($ClO_{3}$)

### History
**J Thomson** -> cathode rays -> electrons (charge - no \#) only charge/mass ratio
Made a vacuum glass tube with charged plates, high voltage ionized the gas and "cathode rays" where discharged. these were electrons and by using charged plates, it was determined they were negative.

**Robert Millikan** -> **oil drop experiment** -> charge (as in quantity) and mass (qty.) of  an electron
**Plum Pudding model**

**Rutherford** -> used radioactive elements that gave out $\alpha$ and $\beta$ particles. they made them go towards a plate of gold. rather than going through, they scattered in every direction, which proved that something extremely heavy was there, aka the  nucleus.

- Removing or adding oxygen from a polyatomic ion doesn't change the charge.

Kinetic energy - Energy of motion, $E_{k} = \frac{1}{2} mv^{2}$
Potential Energy -  Stored Energy $w = F*d$ where $F = \frac{Q_{1}-Q_{2}}{d}$


$LiClO_{2}$ Lithium Clorite
$ClO_2$ Chlorine Dioxide
$HClO_2$ Chlorous Acid
$NH_{4}ClO_{4}$ Ammonium perchlorate

Selenium dichrloride $SeCl_2$
Phosphoric acid $H_3PO_4$
Copper (II) chloride $CuCl_2$
Aluminum nitride $AlN$

Dynam**ite** is danger**ous** 

### Monoatomic Ion
Ends in -ide.
e.g. nitride -> \#N
### Polyatomic Ioin

| Change in # O | Ion      | Acid     |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1             | per-ate  | per-ic   |
| 0             | -ate     | -ic      |
| -1            | -ite     | -ous     |
| -2            | hypo-ite | Hypo-ous |
| -3            |          | Hydro-   |
Note: For acids, keep  adding H$^+$ until the charge is 0
	Hydro usually means no oxygen

### Organic Summary
if it has a (OH) group its an alcohol -ol
if  it has a (OOH) group its an carobnitic acid, ends in -oic
	COOH is (carobnitic acid)


#### Alkanes
compounds made of carbon-hydrogen bonds
the first part of the name depends on the amount of carbon atoms:
1) Meth-
2) Eth-
3) Prop-
4) But-
5) Pen-
6) Hex-
7) etc.
followed by -ane. ie Methane, Propane, etc.
#### Alcohols
When a hydrogen atom is replaced by another group of atoms, we call the group of atoms a functional group.
If we replace a -H for an -OH, we made an alcohol.
* The ending changes to -ol.
Methane is CH$_4$, but if its instead CH$_3$(OH) its methanol.
#### Carboxylic Acids
When a hydrogen atom is replaced -OOH, the -e ending is replaced with -oic. ie Ethane -> Carboxylic Acid + Methane -> Methanoic Acid.
Carboxylic Acid + Ethane -> Ethanoic  Acid.
