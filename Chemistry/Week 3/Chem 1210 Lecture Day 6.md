### Definitions
- **Limiting Reactant**: The reactant that fully depletes in a chemical reaction.
- **Excess Reactant**: The reactants left over from a chemical reaction.
### Quantifying Chemical Reactions
Coefficients in a balanced chemical equation tell you how many molecules are consumed and created.
Since we can convert moles to No. of atoms and mass, we can create mass ratios. ie 4 g H$_2$ + 32 g O$_2$ = 36 g H$_2$O

### Limiting Reactants
Most of the times the reactants in a chemical reaction are not in the same ration as the balanced chemical reaction. The result is one reactant being fully depleted before the other. 
The reactant left are called **Excess Reactants**. 
The amount of the **Limiting Reactant**, ie the reactant that will fully  deplete, dictates the amount of product.

### Percent Yield
The ideal quantity of product(s) produced by chemical reaction is called the **Theoretical Yield**.
The real world is not so nice, thus only a fraction of product will actually be made. Thus, $\text{Percent Yield} = \frac{\text{Actual Yield}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} Ã— 100\%$.
