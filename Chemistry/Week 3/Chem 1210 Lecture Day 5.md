### Definitions
* Reactant: The substance destroyed in a chemical reaction.
* Product: The substance created in a chemical reaction.
* Mole (mol): The number of atoms in exactly 12 g of Carbon 12. Used to specify that quantity of something.
### Chemical reactions
A rearrangement of atoms, one or more substances is destroyed (reactants) and one or more substance is created (products).

#### Electrolysis of water
$H_{2}O$(l) -> $2H_{2}$(g) + $O_{2}$(g)

* (s) solid
* (l) liquid
* (g) gas
* (aq) aqueous solution, solvent is water.

### Balancing Equations
To balance an equation, we can only change the coefficient. Changing the subscript means you are changing the type of molecule being used.
ie $H_{2}O$ != $H_{2}O_{2}$

#### Example
Reaction between nitrogen monoxide and  oxygen produce nitrogen dioxide.
2NO(g)+ O$_2$(g) -> 2NO$_2$(g) 

### Types of Reactions
#### Combination Reactions
Two or more substances react to form a single product.
- A + B -> C
#### Decomposition Reactions
One substance reacts to form multiple products.
- D -> E + F
#### Combustion Reactions
Rapid reactions that produce a flame. typically one reactants is O$_2$.
- ie $\text{O}_2$ + $\text{2H}_2$ -> $\text{2H}_{2}\text{O}$
### "Weights" used in chemistry
- Atomic Weight (AW): Average mass of an atom
- Formula Weight (FW): The sum of the AWs of all the atoms given in a chemical formula.
- Molecular Weight (MW): Sum of AWs from atoms in a molecule.
In general, we use MW for molecular substances, and FW for non-molecular substances like ionic solids, metals, etc.

- Mass Percent of X Element = $\frac{(\text{No. of Atoms}_\text{ of X Element})×(\text{AW})}{\text{FW}_\text{of Substance}}$ 
### Avogadro's Number and the Mole
One Mole (mol) is the exact number of atoms found in 12 grams of $^{12}\text{C}$. A rounded value of $\text{6.02} * \text{10}^{23}$


Sodium Carbonate: $\text{Na}_{2}\text{CO}_{3}$

### Molar Mass
The mass of 1 mol of a substance. expressed as g/mol.
The **Molar Mass** of an element is its **atomic weight** in g/mol.

Grams <-(Use molar mass)-> Moles <-(Avogadro's Number)-> Formula units (No. of atoms)

#### Example No. 1
A cow farts 107g of methane (CH$_4$) a day. How many moles and atoms?
C = 14.007 g/mol, H = 1.0078 g/mol, $CH_4$ = (12.007 + 4* 1.0078)g/mol = 16.0382 g/mol
$107\text{g} * \frac{1\text{ mol}}{12.0382\text{ g}}$ = 6.67 mol
$5.93 \text{mol} × \frac{6.022×10^{23}\text{ molecules of CH}_{4}}{1 \text{ mol}}$ =4.03 × 10$^{24}$ molecules

### Empirical Formula from Mass Percentage
1) Convert **Mass %** to grams (Assume 100 g of material)
2) Convert **grams** to **moles**
3) Calculate the mole ratio

#### Example
Empirical formula of a compound that is 82.7 %$_\text{mass}$ Indium (AW=114.8) and 17.3 %$_\text{mass}$ Oxygen (AW=16)?

1) 82.7 g indium
   17.3 g Oxygen
2) 82.7g (In) × $\frac{1\text{ mol}}{114.8\text{ grams}}$ -> 0.720 mol
   17.3 g (O) × $\frac{1\text{ mol}}{16\text{ grams}}$ -> 1.08 mol
3) In = $\frac{0.720\text{ mol}}{0.720\text{ mol}}$ = 1
   O =  $\frac{1.08\text{ mol}}{0.720\text{ mol}}$ = 1.5
4) 1:1.5 -> 2:3 -> In$_2$O$_3$ aka Indium (III) Oxide ie Indium$^{3+}$ Oxide

### Calculating molecular formulas
.Molecular formula is equal to empirical formula times
whole number multiple

Whole number multiple = $\frac{\text{Molecular weight (MW)}}{\text{Empirical formula weight (FW)}}$

We can use combustion analysis. Empirical Formula = CH. We use technique called **Freezing Point Depression** and molecular weight (molar mass) is determined to be 78g/mol. What is the molecular  formula of this compound?

78g/mol × $\frac{1\text{ mol}}{13.0148 g}$ ≈ 6

CH × 6 -> C$_6$H$_6$
