# Lecture

#### Definitions:
* ***Chemistry**: Study of Matter
* ***Matter**: Anything that has mass and occupies space
* ***Properties***: A characteristic behavior of matter, e.g. color density.

What determines whether a molecule is a gas or a liquid is how stronger molecules stick to each other.

States of matter:
* Gas: Compressible and Shapeless
* Liquid: In-compressible and Shapeless
* Solid: In-compressible

| Elements: Atoms with the same number of protons | Homogenius: Composition and Properties are uniform        |
| Compounds: Molecule with different elements     | Heterogeneous: Composition and Properties are non-uniform |
