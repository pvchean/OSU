### Measuring Reaction Enthalpies
Calorimetry is the science of measuring the flow of heat in chem reactions.

### Heat Capacity
the **Heat Capacity** of a substance is the amount of heat (in Joules) that must be added to raide the temperature of a substance by 1°K (1°C).
- Molar heat capacity, $C_m$ - Energy (J) to raise 1 mole of substance by 1°K (1°C)
  $q = \Delta T \times (C_{m}\times n)$
  Where n = number of moles
- Specific heat capacity, $C_s$, Energy (J) to raise 1 gram of substance by 1°K (1°C)
  $q = \Delta T \times (C_{m}\times m)$
  Where m = mass in grams

calorie = energy to raise 1g of water by 1°C
Calorie = energy to raise 1kg of water by 1°C

### Hess' Law
It states that if  a reaction is carried in a series of steps, Delta H for the overall reaction equals the sum of the enthalpy changes for the individual steps. it is a direct consequence of the fact that enthalpy is a state function.
