### Definitions
- **Thermodynamics**: The study of energy and its transformations
- **Thermochemistry**: The study of the heat that is released or consumed by chemical reactions.

### Electrostatic Potential Energy
coulumbs law

F = $\frac{1}{4\pi e_{0}}* \frac{|Q_{1}||Q_{2}|}{d^{2}}$  
Potential Energy = $F*d$
F = $k\frac{|Q_{1}||Q_{2}|}{d^{2}}$  
Potential Energy = $k \frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{d}$
$k = 8.99*10^{9}j*m/C^{2}$

### First law of Thermodynamics
Energy can be converted from one form to another, but cannot be made of destroyed.

### System and surroundings
The portion of the universe we single out to study is called the system.
The surroundings are everything else, e.g. cylinder pistons and everything beyond the chemistry.

**Open System**: Matter and energy can be exchanged with the surrounding.
**Closed System**: Energy can be exchanged with the surrounding but matter cannot.
**Isolated System**: Neither energy or mater can be exchanged with the surrounding.

Internal Energy, E, of a system encompasses all the kinetic and potential energy of a system. 
$\Delta E = \text{heat} + \text{work}$
$\Delta = q + w$
Where:
- q is the amount of heat entering the system.
- w is the amount of work entering the system.
- $\Delta E$ is the net gain of energy of the system.

$\Delta < 0$: Energy has left the system.
$\Delta > 0$: Energy has entered the system.
$\Delta=0$: Energy has neither entered or left the system.

**Exothermic Reaction**: A chemical reaction that releases heat.
**Endothermic Reaction**: A chemical reaction that absorbs heat.

A **State Function** is a quantity whose value only depends in its current state, not the process in which the system reached the current state.

### Enthalpy
Defined as the internal energy plus the product of pressure and volume.
$H = E + PV$
Internal Energy, Pressure and Volume are state functions, thus Enthalpy is also a state function.

#### Constant Pressure Processes
The change in enthalpy, $\Delta H$, is
$\Delta H = \Delta(E + PV)$
when changes occur at a constant pressure. Most common in closed systems isolated from atmospheric pressure
$\Delta H = \Delta E + P \Delta V$
- Where $\Delta V$ is the work done by the expansion or contraction of gas (pressure-volume work)
#### Pressure-Volume Work
Neglecting work done by redox reactions (ie. batteries and fuel cells), usually the only work done by chemical or physical change is the mechanical work associated with a change in volume of gasses in the system.
