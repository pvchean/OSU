- **Solutions**: homogeneous mixtures of two or more substances.
- **Solvent**: the substance in greatest abundance in a solution.
- **Solute**: whatever is not the solvent.
- **Aqueous Solution**: When the solvent is water
### Acids and bases
- **Acids** produce $H^{+}$ when dissolved in water.
- **Bases** produce $OH^{-}$ when dissolved in water.
- **Electrolytes** separate into ions when dissolved in water, and the ions move electric charge thus conduct electricity.
  **All** soluble ionic compounds are **Strong Electrolytes**

For a substance to be a strong Acid, Base, or electrolyte, it must fully disassociate when dissolved in water.

### Redox Reactions
The transfer of electrons from one reactant to another.
Example: $Mg(\text{s}) + NiCL_{2}(\text{aq}) \rightarrow MgCl_{2}(\text{aq}) + Ni(s)$
**Oxidized**: When a species looses electrons.
**Reduced**: When a species gains electrons.

### Oxidation Numbers
ON's keep track of the **change** in electron count in elements.
Example: $CO_2$
- $CO_2$ is a neutral compound
- Each $O$ has an oxidation state of -2
- C **must** have an oxidation state of +4

#### General Rules to calculate Oxydation Numbers
Note: Rules ordered in descending importance. Higher rules override the preceding rules.
1) In a neutral compound, ON's must add to 0.
2) In an ion, ON's must add to the charge of the ion.
3) Free elements have an ON of 0.
4) Fluorine is **always** -1
5) Group 1 = +1, Group 2 = +2
6) Hydrogen + Metal (or Boron) = -1 & Hydrogen+Non-Metal= +1
7) Oxygen = -2, (except with Fluorine or Peroxides)
8) Group 17(7A) = -1, Group 16(6A) = -2, Group 15(5A) = -3 (count how many columns from noble gasses)

### Molarity
The No. of moles in a Liter of solution.
$M = \frac{\text{moles}}{\text{liters}}$

### Diluting Solutions
Sometimes you want to dilute a highly concentrated solution (ie the stock) to a lower concentration solution.

$M = \frac{M_{1}*V_{1} + 0*V_{2}}{V_{1} + V_{2}} = \frac{M_{1}*V_{1}}{V_{1} + V_{2}}$

### Electrostatic Potential Energy
Coulumbs law

F = $\frac{1}{4\pi e_{0}} \times \frac{|Q_{1}||Q_{2}|}{d^{2}} = k\frac{|Q_{1}||Q_{2}|}{d^{2}}$  
k = $\frac{1}{4\pi e_{0}}$
Potential Energy = $F \times d = k \frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{d}$
$k = 8.99*10^{9}j*m/C^{2}$

### System and surroundings
The space we are working on is the System.
Everything outside of the system is the surrounding.

**Open System:** Matter and energy can enter or Leave. e.g. A Cup
**Closed System:** Energy can enter or leave. e.g. A closed plastic bottle
**Isolated System:** Nothing can enter or leave. e.g. A thermo-flask, closed beach chiller

### Internal Energy
Internal Energy, **E**, of a system encompasses all the kinetic and potential energy of a system. 
$\Delta E = \text{heat} + \text{work}$
$\Delta E = q + w$
Where:
- **q**: heat *entering* the system.
- **w**: work *entering* the system.
- $\Delta E$ is the net gain of energy of the system.
$\Delta > 0$: Energy has entered the system.

### State function
A quantity that only cares of where it started and where it ended.
### Enthalpy
Defined as the *internal energy* + pressure times volume.
$H = E + PV$

Enthalpy is a state function.

Enthalpy is an **Extensive Property**, thus the amount of chemicals affect the amount of enthalpy:
$2 H_{2}(g) + O_{2}(g) -> 2H_{2}O(g)$       $\Delta H = -483.6kJ$
$4\ H_{2}(g) + 2\ O_{2}(g) -> 4\ H_{2}O(g)$       $\Delta H = 2 \times -483.6kJ$

$\Delta < 0$: Energy has left the system.
$\Delta > 0$: Energy has entered the system.
$\Delta=0$: Energy has neither entered or left the system.

#### Constant Pressure Processes
The change in enthalpy, $\Delta H$, is
$\Delta H = \Delta(E + PV)$
when changes occur at a constant pressure. Most common in closed systems isolated from atmospheric pressure
$\Delta H = \Delta E + P \Delta V$
- Where $P\Delta V$ is the work done by the expansion or contraction of gas (pressure-volume work)
- $\Delta V$ is the change in volume of the closed/isolated system

For constant pressure, if no work is done, $\Delta H = \Delta E$

### Calorimetry
The science of measuring the flow of heat in chem reactions.

### Heat Capacity
the **Heat Capacity** of a substance is the amount of heat (in Joules) that must be added to raise the temperature of a substance by 1°K (1°C).
- **Molar heat** capacity, $C_m$:
   Energy (J) to raise 1 mole of substance by 1°K (1°C)
  $q = \Delta T \times (C_{m}\times n)$
  Where n = number of moles
- **Specific heat** capacity, $C_s$:
  Energy (J) to raise 1 gram of substance by 1°K (1°C)
  $q = \Delta T \times (C_{m}\times m)$
  Where m = mass in grams

calorie = energy to raise 1g of water by 1°C
Calorie = energy to raise 1kg of water by 1°C

### Hess' Law
$\Delta H = \Sigma H_{\text{ever step}}$
It states that if  a reaction is carried in a series of steps, Delta H for the overall reaction equals the sum of the enthalpy changes for the individual steps. it is a direct consequence of the fact that enthalpy is a state function.
