### Dimensional Analysis
Dimensional analysis  is a method of changing the units of a value while keeping the true value unchanged.
- e.g. Ohio has 282.3 people per square mile, France has 123.3 people per square kilometer. we can convert miles to km by multiplying by 1.60934.
- Ohio has 108.99 people per square kilometer.

## Exact Numbers don't change the number of significant figures!
If you start with a value that has 4 s.f. and you do a conversion with exact numbers, the final result will still have 4 significant figures!

### Example 1
Aluminum has density of 2.70 g/cm$^3$.
A package of aluminum foil has 50.0 ft$^2$ of foil with a mass of 227 g. What is the thickness of the aluminum foil in millimeters?

W = d * V -> V = W / d -> V = $\frac{227\text{ g}}{2.70\text{ g}/\text{cm}^{3}}$ -> V = **84.0**74 cm$^3$
 $50.0 \text{ ft}^{2}×(\frac{12\text{ in}}{1\text{ ft}})^{2}×(\frac{2.54\text{ cm}}{1\text{ cm}})^{2}$ = **464**51 cm$^2$
V = A * H -> H = $\frac{V}{A}$ -> H = **84.0**74 cm$^3$ / **464**51 cm$^2$ = $0.00181\text{ cm} × (\frac{10\text{ mm}}{1\text{ cm}}$) = 1.81 × 10<sup>-2</sup> mm

### Law of Constant Composition
The ratio of elements in a compound (its composition) is **always** the same. e.g. H$_2$ 0 has a 2:1 hydrogen to oxygen, always.
Due to the ideal gas law, the hydrogen will always have twice the volume as the oxygen.

### Dalton's Atomic Theory
1) Atoms are composed of extremely small particles called atoms
2) Atoms of the same element are identical, but different elements are different.
3) Elements cant be changed into other elements, created or destroyed through chemical reactions.
4) Compounds are formed when atoms of 2 or more elements combine. A compound always have the same relative number and kind of atoms.
### Law of Multiple Proportions
If two elements, a and b, form more than one compound, the masses of B that combine with a given mass of A are in ratio of small whole numbers.

### Cathode Rays
Streams of negatively  charged particles  were found to emanate from cathode  tubes, causing fluorescence.

You can use magnetic  fields to deflect the electrons.

a) Negative, because same charges repel.
b) The bending will increase because the force increases but the inertia remain the same.
c) The deflection decreases because the force remains the same while inertia increases.

### Millikans Oil Drop Experiment
Measured that charges must have discrete values, ie limit to small increment.

### Plum Pudding model of the atom

### Radioactivity
The spontaneous emission of high energy radiation by an atom.
Atom had more subatomic particles and energy associated with it.

$\alpha$-particles: positively charged, 7400 times heavier than $\beta$-particles
$\beta$-particles: negatively charged, high energy electrons
$\gamma$-particles: no charge, no mass because it is electromagnetic radiation.

Disproved the Plum Pudding Atomic Model.
Proved that the atom had very dense parts, and where mostly empty space.
### Modern view of the atom
Nucleus contains almost all of the mass, and all of the positive charge.
- Made of Protons and Neutrons
Most of the volume is occupied by Electrons, and contain all of the negative charge.

### Forces within the Atom
1) Electrostatic charge:
   - Holds the electrons near the nucleus
2) Strong Nuclear Force:
   - Holds the nucleus together. Very strong but must be extremely close.
3) Weak Nuclear Force:
   * Weaker than strong nuclear force

### Symbolic representation of Atoms
$^{12}_6$C
* 12: The number of protons and neutrons in the atom.
* 6: The number of protons or electrons in the atom.
* C: The element of the element.
#### Isotopes
Isotopes are Atoms of the same element with a different number of neutrons.
Examples for carbon:
* $^{11}$C has 5 neutrons.
* $^{12}$C has 6 neutrons.
* $^{13}$C has 7 neutrons.
* $^{14}$C has 8 neutrons.
* *Most carbon found in nature is $^{12}$C*

### Class Participation
1) $^{31}$P$^{3-}$, 15 Protons, 16 Neutrons, 34 Electrons
2) $^{79}$Se$^{2-}$, 34 Protons, 45 Neutrons, 36 Electrons
3) $^{119}$Sn$^{4+}$, 50 Protons, 69 Neutrons, 46 Electrons
4) $^{31}$Au$^{3+}$, 79 Protons, 118 Neutrons, 82 Electrons

### The Atomic Mass Unit
The atoms have extremely small masses. e.g. H has a mass of 1.67.35 × 10$^{-24}$ g.
1 amu = 1.66054 × 10$^{-24}$ g

Atomic weights in the periodic table list the average masses of elements. ie more common isotopes weight their percentage towards the average.

We can measure the mass of atoms through a Mass Spectrometer


$\left(\frac{12\,\text{in}}{1\,\text{ft}}\right)^2$
