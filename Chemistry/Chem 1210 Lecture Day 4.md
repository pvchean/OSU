The signal intensity of a mass spectrometers shows the amount of atoms of that isotope. the ratio of the peaks is the ratio of isotopes found on the material used.

The atomic mass shown in periodic tables is a weighted average

### Periodic table
- Elements in the same row are in the same  period.
- Elements in the same column are in the same group.
When seeing each element in atomic order, a pattern shows of non reactive gas, soft reactive metal, metal, non reactive gas, etc. Thus the periodic table was sorted.

### Metals vs Nonmetals
**Properties of metallic elements:**
* Shiny Luster
* Good conductors of heat, electricity
* Solids (except Mercury)
* Malleable and ductile
**Non-Metallic elements can be:**
- Solid, Liquid or Gas
- Variable in appearance (Color, luster, etc.)
- Large variation in heat/electric conductivity
- Solids are brittle

### Microscopic Classification of Pure Substances
- Monatomic Substances: Noble gasses
- Metallic Substances:
	- Elements
	- Compounds
- Molecular Substance: 
	- Elements
	- Compounds
	The molecule interact with eachother but the individual molecule is never altered.
* Ionic substances:
	* compounds only
### Diatomic Elements
$\text{H}_2$, $\text{N}_2$, $\text{O}_2$, $\text{F}_2$, $\text{Cl}_2$, $\text{Br}_2$, $\text{I}_2$

### Molecular vs Empirical Formula
Empirical formulas give the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of each element in a compound.
- ie. $H_2O$, HO
Molecular Formulas give the exact number of atoms of each element in a comound.
- ie. $H_2O$, $H_2O_2$
### Ions
When an atom of a group of atoms loses or gains electrons, it becomes an ion.
- **Cations** are formed when 1+ electron is lost, atom is +. Monatomic cations are formed by metals.
- **Anions** are formed when 1+ electron is gained. Monatomic anions are formed by non-metals except noble gasses.

### Ionic Compounds
generally formed between metals and non-metals.
The charges always balance out, one atom gives the same number or electrons another atom receives.
There are no discrete molecules, always shown in Empirical formula.
They make a lattice /repeating chain of infinitely many atoms.

What is the empirical formula of the ionic compound between calcium and chlorine? It's $CaCl_{2}$

### Naming Ionic Compounds
1) Cations
	- If the cation can have  more than 1 state of charge, we use roman numerals.
		- $Fe^{2+}$ is written as iron(II)
		- $Cr^{3+}$ is written as chromium(III)
2) Anions
	- For monatomic anions derived from anions  the ending changes to -ide,
		- Cl$^-$ becomes chloride
	- For polyatomic anions name isn't changed
3) Cations are written before Anions
#### Oxygen pre-post fixes
- NO$_4^-$: pernitrate
- NO$_3^-$: nitrate
- NO$_2^-$: nitrite
- NO$_1^-$: hyponitrite
### What are Acids?
A substance whose molecules yield hydrogen ions ($H^+$) when dissolved in water.
Most acids can be thought as an anion(-) with enough H+ to balance charge:
- $HCl$
- $H_2S$
- $HNO_3$
- $H_3PO_4$

| No. of Oxygen | Prefix | Postfix | example                    |
| ------------- | ------ | ------- | -------------------------- |
| 0             | Hydro- |         | Hydroidic Acid (HI)        |
| 1             | Hypo-  | -ous    | Hypochlorous Acid (HClO)   |
| 2             |        | -ous    | Chlorous Acid (HClO$_2$)   |
| 3             |        | -ic     | Chloric Acid (HClO$_3)$    |
| 4             | Per-   | -ic     | Perchloric Acid (HClO$_4$) |

ending in -ol means its an alcohol, thus has an OH group

### Alkanes
compounds made of carbon-hydrogen bonds
the first part of the name depends on the amount of carbon atoms:
1) Meth-
2) Eth-
3) Prop-
4) But-
5) Pen-
6) Hex-
7) etc.
followed by -ane. ie Methane, Propane, etc.
### Alcohols
When a hydrogen atom is replaced by antoher group of atoms, we call tht group of atoms a functional group.
If we replace a -H for an -OH, we made an alcohol.
* The ending changes to -ol.
Methane is CH$_4$, but if its instead CH$_3$(OH) its methanol.

### Carboxylic Acids
When a hydrogen atom is replaced -OOH, the -e ending is replaced with -oic. ie Ethane -> Ethanoic Acid. Methane -> Methanoic Acid.

### Isomers
Compounds that have the same molecular formula but that can have different molecular structures.
ie *n*-butane vs isobutane
