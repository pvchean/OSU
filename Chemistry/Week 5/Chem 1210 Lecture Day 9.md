### Oxidation-Reduction Reactions
Redox reactions involve the transfer of one or more electrons from one reactants to another.
The species that looses electrons is said to be oxidized.
The species that gains electrons is said to be reduces.

**Oxidation Numbers**
used to keep track of electrons in a reaction. the mechanism is to assign atoms oxidation umbers.
if the oxidation umber of the elements change from reactant to product, the reaction is an oxidation reaction reaction. if the didnt it isnt redox reaction.

### Assigning Oxidation Numbers
1) For an atom in its elemental form, the oxidation umber is **always** zero.
2) for any monoatomic ion, the oxidation number equals ionic charge.
3) Sum of oxidation number in neutral compound must sum to zero.  for polyatomic ion they must add to the charge of the ion.
4) oxidation numbers for some atoms are predictable:
	- Oxygen is usually -2, except O_2 and $O_{2}^{2-}$
	- Fluorine is -1, except $F_2$
	- Halogens are usually -1 unless bounded with fluorine or oxygen
	- Hydrogen +1 when bounded to non-metals, -1 when bonded to metals.
	- Oxidation numbers are bounded y the expectations of octet rule. ie oxidation for N ranges from 3- to 5+
Example:

2$Ca$(s) + $O_2$(g) -> 2$CaO$(s)
where Ca becomes +2 and O becomes -2.
