### Molarity
The amount of dissolved solute in a solution is called concentration.
Molarity (M) is one way to measure the concentration of a solution:
$\text{molarity} = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{liters of solution}}$

!!! You divide by the liters of **Solution** not water!!!
##### Question 1
What is the molarity of a solution made by dissolving 45.5 g of $CuSO_{4}*5H_{2}$ (FW=249.5 g/mol) in enough water to make 150.0mL of solution?

$45.5g * \frac{1\text{ mol}}{249.7\text{ g}} = 0.182 mol$
$150.0\text{ mL} * \frac{1\text{ L}}{1000\text{ mL}} = 0.1500\text{ L}$
$\text{molarity} = \frac{0.182\text{ mol}}{0.1500\text{ L}} = 1.21 M$

##### Question 2
How many moles of $CuSO_{4}*5H_{2}O$ are there in 25.0 mL of a 1.46 *M* Solution?

$M * \text{L} = \text{mol}$ -> $1.46 M * 25.0\text{ mL} * \frac{1\text{ L}}{1000\text{ mL}} = 0.0365\text{ mol}$

##### Question 3
What is the molarity of a solution made by dissolving 12.5 g of $Na_{2}CrO_{4} \frac{molar mass = 162 g}{mol}$ in enough water to make 500.0 mL of solution?

$\text{moles of solute} = 12.5 g * \frac{1\text{ mol}}{162\text{ g}} = 0.0772\text{ mol}$
$M = \frac{0.0722\text{ mol}}{0.500\text{ L}} = 0.154\ M$

### Concentrations of Mixed Solution
If we mix together two solutions of different concentrations, we calculate the concentration of the new solution by summing the number of moles in each solution and the volumes of each solution.

$\text{molarity of mixture} = \frac{\text{moles of solute solution}_{1} + \text{moles of solute solution}_{2}}{\text{liters solution}_{1} + \text{liters solution}_{2}}$

##### Question 1
What is the concentration if we mix, 85.0 mL @ 0.350 *M* & 115.0 mL @ 1.10 *M*?
$\text{mol} = M * \text{L}$
$M = \frac{0.350M * 85.0\text{ mL} + 1.10M * 115.0\text{ mL}}{(85.0\text{ mL} + 115.0\text{ mL})} * \frac{1\text{ L}}{1000\text{ mL}} = 0.782 M$

### Diluting Solutions
Sometimes you want to dilute a highly concentrated solution (ie the stock) to a lower concentration solution.

$M = \frac{M_{1}*V_{1} + 0*V_{2}}{V_{1} + V_{2}} = \frac{M_{1}*V_{1}}{V_{1} + V_{2}}$  

##### Question 1.
What mass of $NaOH$ is needed to precipitate the $Cd^{2+}$ ions from 55.0 mL of 0.400 *M* $Cd(NO_{3})_{2}$ solution? What mass of $Cd(OH)_{2}$ is produced?

$Cd(NO_{3})_{2}(\text{aq}) + 2NaOH(\text{s}) â†’ Cd(OH)_{2}(\text{s}) + NaNO_{3}(\text{aq})$   

$\text{mol }Cd(NO_{3})_{2} = 0.400M * 55.0\text{ mL} * \frac{1\text{ L}}{1000\text{ mL}} = 0.022 \text{ mol}$

$0.022 \text{ mol}\ Cd(NO_{3})_{2} * \frac{2 NaOH}{1 Cd(NO_3)_{2}} * \frac{40.00 g NaOH}{1 mol NaOH} = 1.76\ g\ NaOH$

$0.022 \text{ mol}\ Cd(NO_{3})_{2} * \frac{1\ mol\ Cd(OH)_{2}}{1\ mol\ Cd(NO_{3})_{2}} * \frac{146\ Cd(OH)_{2}}{1\ mol\ Cd(OH)_{2}} = 3.22\ g\ Cd(OH)_{2}$
