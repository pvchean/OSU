### Standard Enthalpy of Formation
The standard enthalpy of formation of a compound $\Delta H_{f}\degree$ is the change in enthalpy for the  reaction that forms one mole of that compound from its elements

$\Delta H_{rxn}\degree = \Sigma n \Delta H_{f}\degree(products) - \Sigma n \Delta H_{f}\degree(reactants)$

##### Example
$2CO(\text{g}) + O_{2}(\text{g}) \rightarrow 2CO_{2}(\text{g})$
$2[C(\text{graphite}) + O_{2}(\text{g}) \rightarrow CO_{2}(g)]\ \ \ \ 2\Delta H_{f}\degree(CO_{2})$
$2[CO(\text{g}) \rightarrow C(\text{graphite}) + \frac{1}{2}O_{2}(\text{g})]\ \ \ \ -2\Delta H_{f}\degree$
### Bond Enthalpies
- **Bond Enthalpy**: The enthalpy associated with breaking one mole of a particular bond in a gaseous substance.
- Always a positive number. Energy is required to break chemical bond.
- Stronger Bond = Greater Enthalpy
- Energy is **always** released when bonds form between gaseous fragments.

$\Delta H_{rxn} = \Sigma(\text{BE of bonds broken}) - \Sigma(\text{BE of bonds formed})$
