### Example 1
Use bond enthalpies to estimate the enthalpy of the following reaction:
$CH_{4}(\text{g}) + CL_{2}(\text{g}) \rightarrow CH_{3}Cl(\text{g}) + HCl(\text{g})$

Bond Enthalpy:
- C-H = 413 kJ/mol
- Cl-Cl = 242 kJ/mol
- H-Cl = 431 kJ/mol
- C-Cl = 328 kJ/mol

In the equation, one C-H is broken, one Cl-Cl is broke, one C-Cl is made, and one H-Cl is made:
$\Sigma H = 413 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{mol}} + 242 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{mol}} - 328 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{mol}} - 431 \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{mol}} = -104  \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{mol}}$

### Properties of waves
A propagating disturbance that travels through a medium, transporting energy as it moves through a medium.
**Wave length** ($\lambda$): The distance between two points where the wave repeats.
**Frequency** ($v$) - the number of waves that pass through a fixed point in one second.

1)Wave Velocity = $\lambda \times v$

### Electromagnetic Radiation
Oscillating electric  and magnetic fields that can transport energy without a medium, unlike waves.
All electromagnetic radiation move at the speed of light.

$c = \lambda \times v \leftrightarrow \lambda = \frac{c}{v} \leftrightarrow v = \frac{c}{\lambda}$
c = speed of light

The observation made that light behaves as a wave led to the development of quantum theory, which changed the way we vew the behaviour of atoms and molecules.

1) black body radiation
2) the photoelectric effect
3) The emission spectra of excited gaseous atoms

### Black body radiation
When an object is heated, they emmit electromagnetic radiation (light). the wavelength distribution depends on temperature and is called black body radiation.

Planck proposed that light can only be emitted with energies that come in discrete chunks.
$E = hv = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$
$h = 6.626\times10^{-34}\ J \times s$
#### Quantization of Energy
Planck's theory stated that matter can only absorb or emit energy whole number multiples of $hv$.

### Photoelectric Effect
calcium requires photons with a minimum energy in order to emmit electrons.

### Line Spectra
In 1885, Johann Balmer discovered a simple formula relating the four emission lines of hydrogen to integers, then generalized the formula
$\frac{1}{\lambda} = R_{H}\left(\frac{1}{n_{1}^{2}} - \frac{1}{n_{2}^{2}}\right)$
- $R_{H} = 1.0968\times10^{7}\ m^{-1}$

### Bohr Model
Niels Bohr put forward a model of the hydrogen model that explained its emission spectrum.
He assumed that electrons orbit the nucleus in a circular orbit that are quantized, thus electrons don't are restricted to fixed orbits.
The energy is emitted or absorbed when electrons move into another orbit, where the energy of the photon is:
$E = hv$

**Planck's Equation**: $E = \frac{hv}{\lambda}$
**Rydberg's Equation**: $\frac{1}{\lambda} = R_{H}\left(\frac{1}{n_{1}^{2}} - \frac{1}{n_{2}^{2}}\right)$
Plank + Rydberg -> $E = hcR_{H}\left(\frac{1}{n_{1}^{2}} - \frac{1}{n_{2}^{2}}\right)$
