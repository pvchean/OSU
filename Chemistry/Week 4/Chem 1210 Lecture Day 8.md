### Definitions
- **Solutions**: homogeneous mixtures of two or more substances.
- **Solvent**: the substance in greatest abundance in a solution.
- **Solute**: whatever is not the solvent.
- **Aqueous Solution**: When the solvent is water

## How ionic compounds form solutions
When ionic compounds dissolve in water, the anions and cations separate into the solvent.
because water is polar, this happens. Most  ions are only solvent in polar  solvents.
When molecules dissolve in solvents like water, they **remain intact and do  not form ions**, unless its acids or other base molecules.

### Electrolyte and non-electrolytes
A **strong electrolyte** disassociates completely into ions when dissolved in water, making the solution conduct electricity. they steal hydrogen from water?
**weak electrolyte** when only partial disassociation.
**non electrolyte** does not disassociate into ions.
- Most water soluble substances are non-electrolytes

### Strong vs Weak Acids
**Strong acids** give their hydrogen to water. No hydrogen remains on.
$HCl(\text{aq}) + H_{2}O → H_{3}O^{+} + Cl^{-}(\text{aq})$ 

**Weak acids** give and take hydrogen from water. Still have hydrogen left over.
$HClO_{2}(\text{aq}) + H_{2}O ⇆ H_{3}O^{+}(\text{aq}) + ClO_{2}^{+}(\text{aq})$ 

Sodium Hydroxide is strong acid because it makes 1 mol Na+ and 1mol OH-.
Acetic Acid, CH3COOH is weak because it has 3 products.

### Precipitation Reaction
Two solutions containing soluble salts (ions) are mixed, and react and make a salt that is  **not** soluble in water, thus precipitates/separates out.

### Metathesis or Exchange Reactions
A reaction where anions and cations switch between two ions.
ie $A_{1}C_{1}+ A_{2}C_{2}-> A_{1}C_{2} + A_{2}C_{1}$
 
- A precipitation reaction is a type of Metathesis reaction.

### Neutralization Reactions
A reaction between an acid and a base. When the base is a metal hydroxide,  water and a salt is produced.
when writing net ionic equations for neutralization reactions, one must keep in mind insoluble ionic compounds and weak acids/bases are not separated into ions.

$Na_{2}CO_{3}(\text{aq}) + Co(NO_{3})_{2}(\text{aq}) → CoCO_{3}(\text{s}) + 2NaNO_{3}(\text{aq})$ 

### Acids
Substances that dissociate in aqueous solution to produce H+ ions.

### Bases
when dissolved in water increase the concentration of OH-. take H+ from water, or provide OH- molecule.



HBr Strong acid
$H_2SO_3$ weak acid, if we take 2 H+ away, SO_3$^{-2}$ is left over and its going to make other acids
KOH Strong Base
$CH_3CH_2OH$ Neither (alcohols are neither acid nor bases)
$CH_3CH_2CH_2OOH$ Weak acid
NaClO_4 Neither (ionic compound,  no hydrogen)


for something to be a strong electrolytes, there is no chloric acid left. you know that because you just memorize it.

A weak electrolyto only gives out some. 


**All soluble ionic compounds are strong electrolytes**
strong are 1:1, 1 more create 1 mole
HCLO_3 -> H+ ClO_3 -
