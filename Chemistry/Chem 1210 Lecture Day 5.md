### Definitions
* Reactant: The substance destroyed in a chemical reaction.
* Product: The substance created in a chemical reaction.
* Mole (mol): The number of atoms in exactly 12 g of Carbon 12. Used to specify that quantity of something.
### Chemical reactions
A rearrangement of atoms, one or more substances is destroyed (reactants) and one or more substance is created (products).

#### Electrolysis of water
$H_{2}O$(l) -> $2H_{2}$(g) + $O_{2}$(g)

* (s) solid
* (l) liquid
* (g) gas
* (aq) aqueous solution, solvent is water.

### Balancing Equations
To balance an equation, we can only change the coefficient. Changing the subscript means you are changing the type of molecule being used.
ie $H_{2}O$ != $H_{2}O_{2}$

#### Example
Reaction between nitrogen monoxide and  oxygen produce nitrogen dioxide.
2NO(g)+ O$_2$(g) -> 2NO$_2$(g) 

### Types of Reactions
#### Combination Reactions
Two or more substances react to form a single product.
- A + B -> C
#### Decomposition Reactions
One substance reacts to form multiple products.
- D -> E + F
#### Combustion Reactions
Rapid reactions that produce a flame. typically one reactants is O$_2$.
- ie $\text{O}_2$ + $\text{2H}_2$ -> $\text{2H}_{2}\text{O}$
### "Weights" used in chemistry
- Atomic Weight (AW): Average mass of an atom
- Formula Weight (FW): The som of the AWs of all the atoms given in a chemical formula.
- Molecular Weight (MW): Sum of AWs from atoms in a molecule.
In general, we use MW for molecular substances, and FW for non-molecular substances like ionic solids, metals, etc.

- Mass Percent of X Element = $\frac{(\text{No. of Atoms}_\text{ of X Element})Ã—(\text{AW})}{\text{FW}_\text{of Substance}}$ 
### Avogadro's Number and the Mole
One Mole (mol) is the exact number of atoms found in 12 grams of $^{12}\text{C}$. A rounded value of $\text{6.02} * \text{10}^{23}$


Sodium Carbonate: $\text{Na}_{2}\text{CO}_{3}$
