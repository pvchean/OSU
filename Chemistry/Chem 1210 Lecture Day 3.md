When decomposing 3 moles water, you get 2 moles of hydrogen and 1 mole of oxygen. Hydrogen will have twice the volume of oxygen.

A **Homogeneous mixture** is known as a **Solution**.

**Examples of Homogeneous Mixtures**:
* 14 Carat Gold (Solid)
* Vodka (Liquid)
* Air (Gaseous)

\- Any combination of gasses would be a solution.

**Physical Methods of Separation**:
- Distillation: The use of temperature to selectively boil a liquid to separate liquids from each other.
- Filtration: Used to separate solids from liquids.
- Chromatography: Used to separate liquids based on how fast they flow through a thing.

#### Work Problem:
Classify the following as either a pure substance  or  a mixture. Further classify them as element, compound, homogeneous mixture, or heterogeneous mixture.

* Rice Pudding - Mixture - Heterogeneous 
* Carbonated Water - Mixture - Homogeneous
* Crushed Ice - Pure Substance - Compound
* Molybdenum - Pure Substance - Element
* Brass (Cu Zn) - Mixture - Homogeneous Mixture

### Definitions
* **Flammables**: Will react and consume oxygen.
* **Oxidant**: Will react with and provide oxygen.
* **Physical Properties** can be measured without changing the substance chemically.
* **Chemical Properties** can *only* be observed if  the substance is changed into another property.
* **Intensive Properties** don't depend on the amount of substance, e.g. boiling point, density or color.
* **Extensive Properties** depend on the amount of substance, e.g. mass, volume, energy.
* **physical changes**: Do not change the composition of a substance. e.g. changes in state, temperature, and volume.
* **Chemical Changes**: Change the composition of a substance. e.g. combustion, oxidation, and decomposition.
- **Heat** is the energy used to cause the temperature of an object to increase.
- **Work** is the energy used to cause an object to be displaced.
- **Kinetic Energy** is the energy of motion. E$_k$ = 1/2 m v$^2$
- **Potential Energy** is stored energy based on the:
	- position of an object (Gravitational).
	- state of a object (Electrostatic).
	  *Note: Chemical Energy is a type of Electrostatic Energy*

### Class problem No. 1
Classify the following as either a physical or chemical process
* Rusting of a metal can - Chemical
* Boiling a cup of water - Physical
* Pulverizing a sugar crystal - Physical
* Exploding a cylinder of nitroglycerin - Chemical
* Electrolysis of water - Chemical

### What is Heat?
**Energy** is the capacity to transfer **Heat** or do **Work**.

### Si Base Units
1) Length, Meters, m
2) Mass, Kilogram, kg
3) Temperature, Kelvin, K
4) Time, Second, s or sec
5) Amount of substance, Mole, mol
6) Luminous intensity, Candela, cd

### Derived Units
1) Volume = length$^3$
2) Density = mass/volume = mass/length$^3$
3) Energy = mass \* length$^2$/time$^2$
4) Acceleration = length/time$^2$

### Common Units
1) **Volume**
	* 1 Liter(L) is 1 dm$^3$
	* 1 mL is 1 cm$^3$
2) **Temperature**
	* K = °C + 273.15
	* °C = K -  273.15
	* °F = 9/5(°C)+32
	* °C = 5/9(°F - 32)
3) **Energy**
	* The **Joule**, a derived unit, is the kinetic energy of a 2 kg object moving at 1 m/s.
		* E$_k$ = 1/2 m v$^2$
		* 1 J = 1/2 (2 kg)(1 m/s)$^2$
	* The **Calorie**(cal) is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water from 14.5°C to 15.5°C.
### Precision vs Accuracy
**Precision** is the measure of how closely individual measurements measure **to each other**.
* e.g. Measurements for a 1 m object: 1.013 1.012 1.013 1.014
**Accuracy** is the measure of how closely individual measurements measure **to reality**.
* e.g. Measurements for a 1 m object: 1.03 0.997 0.998 1.001

### Exact vs. Inexact Numbers
**Exact numbers** are known exactly, with no uncertainty.
**Inexact numbers** depend on how they where measured, and include real life limitations and error.
### Sig. Fig.
All digits of a measured quantity, including the uncertain ones, are called significant figured.
- e.g. on the number 102.03*2*, the two is an estimate
Sig figs are important in order to not overstate the precision of our answers.
the last digit is always uncertain for any measured quantity.
e.g. A balance measures to 0.0001 g, then a reading of 2.2056 g is reported as `2.2056g ± 0.0001g`

#### Counting sig figs
The digit is significant if:
- a digit is non-zero.
- a zero is between non-zero digits.
- a zero is at the end of a number with decimal points.
Examples:
1.03 - 3 Sig. Figs. - the zero is between non-zero digits
1.030 - 4 Sig. Figs. - last zero counts because the number has decimals
0.031 - 2 Sig. Figs. - first two zeros don't count
3.050 x 10$^3$ - 4 Sig. Figs.
3050 - 3 Sig. Figs. - last zero is at the end but has no  decimal.
#### Addition/Subtraction
Must retain the same amount of decimals as the number with least amount of decimals.
- e.g. 20.**4**2 + 1.**3**22 + 83.**1** = 104.8
- e.g. 1.50 x 10$^3$ + 2.38 x 10$^2$ = 1.30 x 10$^3$ + 0.238 x 10$^3$ = 1.74 x 10$^3$
#### Multiplication/Division
Final Sig. Fig is the number of Sig. Figs of the least Sig. Fig number
- e.g. \[2.67 × 10$^3$ − 4.5 × 10$^2$] × 1.360 × 10<sup>−2</sup>
1) . \[2.67 × 10$^3$ − 0.45 × 10$^3$] = 2.22 x 10$^3$
* We maintain 3 figs because subtraction. 2670-450=2220(3)
2) 22.2 x 10$^2$ x 1.360 × 10<sup>−2</sup>
3) 0.3019 x 10$^2$
4) 30.2
