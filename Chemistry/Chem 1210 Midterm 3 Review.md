**Bond Energy**
$\Delta H_{rxn} = \Sigma(\text{BE of bonds broken}) - \Sigma(\text{BE of bonds formed})$

### Electrostatic Potential Energy
$Potential Energy = \kappa\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{d}$
$\kappa = 8.99\times10^{9}J \times m/C^{2}$

For **like charges**: Potential Energy does up as they get closer
For **opposite charges**: Potential Energy goes down as they get closer.

**Chemical Energy:**
Ionic Compounds: As the ions make crystals, the loose potential energy because they get closer.

### First Law of Thermodynamics
Energy can only be converted, not created or destroyed.
$\Delta{E} = heat + work$
$\Delta{E} = q + w$
$+q$ = heat added to the system
$+w$ = work done to the system

### Enthalpy
$\Delta{H} = \Delta{E} + P\Delta{V} = q + w$
in constant pressure: $\Delta{H} = q$

### Hess' Law
$\Delta{H}$ for the overall reaction equals the sum of enthalpy changes of individual steps.
$\Delta{H} = \Sigma \Delta{H}_{i}$

##### Example:

| Reaction                                                                 | Delta Enthalpy           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| $2MnO_{2}(\text{s}) \rightarrow 2MnO(\text{s}) + O_{2}(g)$               | $\Delta{H}_{1} = 135kJ$  |
| $2CO_2(\text{s}) \rightarrow 2CO(\text{g}) + O_{2}(\text{g})$            | $\Delta{H}_{2} = +566kJ$ |
| Hess' Law: $2CO(\text{g}) + O_{2}(\text{g}) \rightarrow 2CO_2(\text{s})$ | $\Delta{H}_{2} = -566kJ$ |
$MnO_{2}(\text{s}) + CO(\text{g}) \rightarrow MnO(\text{g}) + CO_{2})(\text{g})$
$\Delta{H} = (\frac{1}{2})\times135kJ + (\frac{1}{2})-566kJ = -216kJ$ 

##### Example 2:

| Reaction                                | Delta Enthalpy        |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| $2Mg(s) + O_{2}(g) \rightarrow 2MgO(s)$ | $\Delta{H} = -1204kJ$ |
Step 1) Change mass to moles.
Step 2) Using formula, calculate how many times the reaction takes place. ie Mg moles / 2.
Step 3) Result from Step 2 is the theoretical  yield of energy from the reaction.

### Standard Enthalpy of Formation
$\Delta{H}_{f\degree}$ is the change of enthalpy for the reaction taht forms **one mole** of that compont from its elements
**Example:**
$H_{2}(g) + \frac{1}{2}O_{2} \rightarrow H_{2}O(l)$ has $\Delta{H}_{f\degree} = Value$

Standard enthalpy of formation
$\Delta H_{rxn} = \Sigma(\text{EoF of Products}) - \Sigma(\text{EoF of Reactants})$
##### Example
$NiO(s) + 2HCl(g) \rightarrow NiCl_{2}(s) + H_{2}O(g)$
$\Delta{H}_{f\degree}(NiO) = -240kJ/mol$
$\Delta{H}_{f\degree}(HCl) = -92kJ/mol$
$\Delta{H}_{f\degree}(NiCl_{2}) = -305/mol$
$\Delta{H}_{f\degree}(H_{2}O) = -242kJ/mol$

$\Delta H_{rxn} = (-305 + -242) - (-240 + 2 \times -92)$

### Calorimetry - Measuring Reaction Enthalpies
This one focuses on constant-pressure calorimetry
$\Delta{H} = q$
**System:** The stuff that makes or uses heat
**Environment:** Everything Else

1) $q = \Delta{T} * (C_{m} * n)$
   where:
   $C_{m}$ = molar heat capacity
   n = number of moles
2) $q = \Delta{T} \times (C_{s} * m)$
   where:
   $C_{m}$ = Specific Heat
   m = mass
##### Example:
Calculate how much heat is released when 62.5g $H_{2}O_{2}$ (molar mass = 34.0 g/mol) decomposes.
$2H_{2}O_{2} \rightarrow 2H_{2}O + O_{2}$ With $\Delta{H} = -196kJ$

Step 1) Mass to moles
Step 2) Find the number of times reaction takes place. ie mol/2
Step 3) multiply by delta enthalpy to find energy change
$\Delta{H} \approx âˆ’180kJ$
##### Example 2:
62.5 g of hydrogen peroxide is mixed with 2500 g of $H_{2}O$, starting at 25 C, in constant pressure. peroxide decomposes. what is the final temperature of the mixture if the mixture has a specific heat of 4.18 J/g-K?

180 kJ = $\Delta{T} \times (4.18 \times (2500 + 62.5)) = 16.8\degree C$
$\Delta{H}$ is now positive because this is the amount of heat entering the solution, not leaving the reaction from example 1. 
System + Environment = 0 *Thus* -180 kJ + Environment = 0 *Thus* Environment = 180 kJ

### Bond Enthalpies
Enthalpy assosiated with the breaking of one mole of a particular bong in a gaseous substance.
ie: $Cl_{2}(g) \rightarrow 2 Cl(g)$
If we spend more energy breaking bonds, than the bonds that form, $\Delta{H}$ is positive.

$\Delta H_{rxn} = \Sigma(\text{BE of bonds broken}) - \Sigma(\text{BE of bonds formed})$

H-H bond has 436 kJ/mol
Thus:
$H_{2}(g) -> 2H(g)$ has $\Delta{H} = 436 kJ$
$2H(g) -> H_{2}(g)$ has $\Delta{H} = -436 kJ$

### Electromagnetic Spectrum
Wavelength go up, Frequency go down.

more -> less
gamma -> x ray -> ultra violet -> visible, infrared, microwaves, radio.

$c = \gamma \times v$
where:
c = 3$.0 \times 10^8$ (speed of light)

1 Hertz = $1/s^{-1}$
1 kHz = $1000/s^{-1}$

### Black Body Radiation
Energy of light is quantized. It comes in discrete packets.
$E = hv = h\frac{c}{\gamma}$

### Photoelectric Effect
Photons can behave like particles, called photons, each with energy proportional to its frequency.

### Line Spectra and the Bohr  Model
Atoms orbit around specific and fixed orbits. No in between

$\frac{1}{\gamma} = R_{H}\left(\frac{1}{n_{1}^{2}} - \frac{1}{n_{2}^{2}}\right)$
$E = -hcR_{H}\left(\frac{1}{n^{2}}\right)$
where $hcR_{H}$ is the energy of an electron in the n=1 shell, the lowest shell.

##### Example
Electron moves from n=4 to n=1 in a hydrogen atom.
Electron releases a photon.
Change in energy of the atom is:
$\Delta{E} = -hcR_{H}\left(\frac{1}{1^{2}}\right) - -hcR_{H}\left(\frac{1}{4^{2}}\right)$

$E_\text{photon} = -E_\text{atom}$

### Wave -Particle Duality of Matter


### Principal Quantum Number (n)
Energy level in which the electron resides

### Angular Momentum Quantum Number (l)
s -> p -> d -> f
magnetic quantum number ranges from l to -l.
