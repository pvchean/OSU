### Effective Nuclear Charge
- Electrons are both attracted to the core and repelled by other electrons.

The behaviour of elements chemically depends on the valence electrons. Valence electrons are  the electrons from the element past the noble gas until the the element inquestion. See condensed electron Configuration.

The outermost valence electrons dont feel the full charge of the nucleous because of the "Screening" from the inner electrons. the charge that electrons feel is called the **effective nuclear charge**, $Z_\text{eff}$

$Z_\text{eff} = Z - S$
Where:
- Z = Effective Nuclear Charge
- Z = Actual Nuclear Charge (atomic No.)
- S = Electron Screening

**Simple Method:**
- S = No. of core electrons
- $Z_\text{eff} = Z - S$

**Slater's Rules**
S = 1 if $n < n_\text{outer}-1$
S = 0.85 if $n = n_{outer}-1$
S = 0.35 if $n = n_\text{outer}$

For $n = n_\text{outer}$, the multiplier is (No. of Outer shell electrons -1), the electron doesn't shield itself.
ie for Cl:
- $S = 2 \times 1 + 8 \times 0.85 + (7-1) \times 0.35 = 9.5$
$Z_{eff} = Z - S = 17 - 10.9 = 6.1$

### Class Example
Al has Z = 13 and Cl has Z = 17
Al's $e^{-}$ config: $1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}3p^1$
Cl's $e^{-}$ config: $1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}3p^5$

| Al simple method<br>$Z_{eff} = Z - S = 13 - 10 = 3$                                                                       | Cl simple method<br>$Z_{eff} = Z - S = 17 - 10 = 7$                                                                        |

### Sizes of Atoms
The **non-bonding atomic radius**, ie the *van der Wauls radius*, is half of the shortest distance separating two  nuclei during a collision of atoms

The **bonding atomic radius**, or the *covalent radius*, is half the distance between nuclei in a bond.

Radii increasing when moving <- and ↓.

Radii decrease when moving <- because $Z_\text{eff}$ is increasing.
Radii increase when moving ↓ because the value of the principal quantum number is increasing.

### Electron configuration of ions
**Cations:** Electrons are lost from the highest $n$ value shell first.
For sub-shells with the same value of $n$, electrons are lost from sub-shells with higher values of $l$ first.
**Anions** (Only Non-Metals): Electrons are dded to the highest $n$ value shell, or the sub-shell with highest $l$ value.
