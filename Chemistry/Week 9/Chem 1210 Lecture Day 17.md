### Electron Spin
An electron can either have a +1/2 spin or a -1/2 spin.

(n, l, $m_2$)
l = angular momentum equation, n-1, n-2, ..., 0
m_2 can equal L, L-1, L-2, L-n, ..., -L
n = principle quantum number

### Electron Configuration





**Pauli's Exclusion Principle**, you cant have two, two up or two down electrons in the same orbital.
Parallel electrons have less inter particle interaction. thus electron configurations with parallel electrons have less potential energy than one having antiparrallel spread over sub shells  or a shell.
