### Lines and planes in space
Standard Form of a plane equation
ax + by + cz = d

A normal vector is perpendicular to a surface, referred to as the normal vector (n⃗)

### How to find a plane with 3 points
The cross product of two vectors is perpendicular to both vectors. We can use the 3 points to make two vectors, the cross product of both vectors will give our normal vector n⃗.

1) For points A(x1, y1, z1), B(x2, y2, z2), and C(x3, y3, z3), we can make Vectors **AB** and **AC**.
2) n⃗ = **AB** ⨯ **AC** = <\x y z>
3) Use the dot product to find the equation of the plane, since the dot of a vector and the normal equals to zero.
   * **AB** ⨯ n⃗ = 0
4) ax + by + cz = d

#### Practice #1
For A(1,2,4), B(1.3.2), and C(2,2,6)
Vec. AB = (1-1, 3-2, 2-4) = (0, 1, -2)
Vec. AC = (2-1, 2-2,6-4) = (1,0,2)

AB ⨯ AC = 
i   j   k
0 1 -2
1 0   2

### Equation of a parametric line:
M⃗(t) = M$_0$ + tv⃗ where M$_0$ is a point in the line that passes through direction v⃗.
M$_0$ = \<x0, y0, z0>

\<x(t), y(t), z(t)> = \<x0, y0, z0> + t<a, b, c>
				= \<x0 + ta, y0 + tb, z0 + tc>

t = (x-x0)/a = (y-y0)/b = (z-z0)/c

- abc is the direction
#### Practice No. 2
Identify the direction of the vector for the line given by:
x = 1+2t, y = 3-t, z = 4+3t

the direction is \<2, -1, 3>

### Equation of a Circle
- **Cartesian**:
  x$^2$ + y$^2$ = r$^2$ 
  If the center of the circle is located at \<h,k>, the equation is now (x-h)$^2$ + (y-k)$^2$ = r$^2$
- **Parameterized Polar Coordinates**:
  x=r*cos*(t), y = r*sin*(t)
  t = \[0,2π]
  If the center of the circle is located at \<h,k>, the equation is now x = h + r*cos*(t), y = h + r*sin*(t)
### Partial Derivatives
Only for multi-variable functions. Used to find the Rate of Change of multi-variable function with respects to one variable while the other variables are considered constants.

#### Example No. 3
PD of f w×r×t is denoted by df/dx of f$_x$
![[IMG_20240822_143846_829.jpg]]


f(x,y) = x$^2$y + 3x$y^2$
∂x = 2xy + 3y$^2$
∂y = x$^2$ + 6xy
