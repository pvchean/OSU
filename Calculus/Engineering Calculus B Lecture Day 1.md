### Things that I need to review
Vecors: Addition/Sub, Mult, Div, Dot and cross
Partial Derivatives
Improper something something

### Notes
Applying a dot product on two different vectors, with a magnitude > 0, you can check if they are perpendicular if the result is zero.


#### Cross Product

| 2x2 | +-<br>-+          |
| --- | ----------------- |
| 3x3 | +-+<br>-+-<br>+-+ |

Vec. A x Vec. B is a vector perpendicular to Vec. A & B

1) U x V = 
2) 

| i   | j   | k   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| u1  | u2  | u3  |
| v1  | v2  | v3  |
 3) 
 i\[u2 u3] - j\[u1 u3] + k\[u1 u2]
  \[v2 v3]     \[v1 v3]      \[v1 v2]
4)  i(u2v3-u3v2) - j(u1v3-u3v1) + k(u1v2-u2v1)

If two vectors are parallel, the cross product is zero

### Parallelogram of vectors
The area of triangle made from vectors is:
1) 1/2 \*(times) |AxB|
2) 1/2 * A * B * Cos(Theta)

### Partial Derivatives
when doing partial derivatieve of a variable, e.g. x, treat every other variables, e.g. y z, as constants.

1) F(x,y) = X^3 + 5x^2 y^4 
   What is df/df?
   df/dy=0y(x^3) + 4(5x^2)(y^3)
   df/dy = 20x^2 y^3

2) F(x,y) = Sin(yx^2)
   df/dx = Cos(yx^2) * (yx^2)'
