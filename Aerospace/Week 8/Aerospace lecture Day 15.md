### Definitions:
**Chord**: the distance between the leading edge and the trailing edge.
**Camber Line**: $\frac{1}{2}$ way between upper and lower surface.
**Camber**: The maximum distance between the Camber Line and Chord.
**Thickness**: The distribution, as shown.
**Angle of Attack** ($\alpha$): The angle between $\overrightarrow V_{\infty}$ and Chord. $\overrightarrow V_{\infty}$ relative to the airfoil, not A/C.
**Moment**: Tendency to rotate. Depends on the choice of hinge.

### Airfoil
An Airfoil is completely defines by the mean camber line and thickness.

The result of an Airfoil traveling through a fluid at $\overrightarrow V_{\infty}$, is a resultant force $\overrightarrow R$ with two components:
L, which is $\perp \overrightarrow V_{\infty}$, or $N\perp \overrightarrow C$
D, which is $\parallel \overrightarrow V_{\infty}$, or  $A\parallel \overrightarrow C$

$L = N\cos{\alpha} - A\sin{\alpha}$
$D = N\sin(\alpha) + A\cos{\alpha}$

L, D, M, depend on the Airfoil Shape, $\alpha$, $V_{\infty}$, $\rho_{\infty}$, S, $a_{\infty}$, and $\mu_{\infty}$.
### Moments

M is about one point is known, the the M about another point can be found through *Parallel Axis Theorem*.
($\overrightarrow R, M$) change with $\alpha$

The point in which Moment does nto change with Angle of Attack ($\alpha$) is called the **Aerodynamic Center**.
$M_{AC} = \text{Const.}$ for all $\alpha$

$M_{ac} \approx M_\frac{c}{4}$ (Low Speed Airfoil only)
$C_{l} = \frac{L}{q_{\infty}S}$
$C_{d} = \frac{D}{q_{\infty}S}$
$C_{m} = \frac{M}{q_{\infty}SC}$

In order to relate wind tunnel test to actual flights:
1) Similar geometric bodies
2) same similarity parameters ($Re, M_{\infty}$)
3) Dynamical Similarities
4) $C_{l}$, $C_{d}$, $C_{m}$ are the same for both flows
5) Wind Tunnel data directly wed in actual flight
