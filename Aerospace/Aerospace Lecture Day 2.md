### Class Goals
Determine C$_L$ and C$_D$

### How do things fly?
An airplane has 4 forces:
* Weight: A force pulling the aircraft downwards equal to the mass\*gravity of the aircraft.
* Lift: A force pulling the aircraft upwards equal or greater than the weight
* Drag, A retrograde force slowing the aircraft.
* Thrust: A Pro-grade force accelerating  the aircraft, greater or equal to the drag force.
### Definitions
#### Lift Equation
**L = 1/2 ρ V$_∞$$^2$ S C$_L$**
Where:
* ρ is density of the fluid
* S is the wing surface area
* C$_L$ is the lift coefficient
* V$_∞$ is velocity
#### Lift Coefficient
A unit-less number that describes the lift characteristics of an aircraft.
C$_L$ is directly influenced by the *airfoil shape* and the *angle of attack* (alpha 𝛼)

#### Angle of Attack (Alpha 𝛼)
The angle of attack is the angle between a line formed from the leading edge of the airfoil to the trailing edge of the airfoil, and the horizon.

#### Drag Formula
D (Drag) = 1/2 ρ V$_∞$$^2$ S C$_d$ (Coefficient: Drag)
Typically Drag is less than Lift
L/D = C$_L$/C$_D$ ≈ 34 (For Gliders)

#### Dynamic Pressure
Formula: 1/2 ρ V$_∞$$^2$ 

### Example 1:
A person in a glider.

**Known**:
* W$_1$ (Person): 170 lbs
* W$_2$ (Glider): 30 lbs
* ρ = 0.00238 slug/ft$^3$

**Initial**:
* V = 5 mph = 7.33 ft/s
* C$_L$ = 1.0
**Unknown**:
* S (Surface Area)
L = 1/2 ρ V$_∞$$^2$ S C$_L$ = W = 200 lbs
S = 3100 ft$^2$

#### What if we fly faster?
V = 30 mph = 43.98 ft/s

Now S = 86.1 ft$^2$

### Example 2:
Is there any rules governing all flying things? Small to large?

W = L = 1/2 ρ V$_∞$$^2$ C$_L$ S

**W/S (Wing Loading)** = 1/2 ρ V$_∞$$^2$ C$_L$
Too high of a wing loading can damage the structure, if not designed accordingly.

For anything with length of b, S ≈ b$^2$, W ≈ b$^3$
 W/S ≈ b ≈ (W)<sup>1/3</sup> ≈ C$_2$ (W)<sup>1/3</sup> 

### Flight Regimes
Mach is defined as Velocity / Speed of Sound

#### Flight Regimes
* Incompressible (M 0-0.3): Density of Air is constant.
* Compressible/Subsonic (M 0.3-0.8): Density of air changes, enough to be accounted for.
* Transonic (M 0.8-1.2): Subsonic with local supersonic flow.
* Supersonic (M 1.2-5): No subsonic flow, Shockwave formation and increased pressures  and temperatures.
* Hypersonic (M 5+): Extremely high pressures and temperatures. Air becomes disassociated and no longer behaves as an ideal gas.
