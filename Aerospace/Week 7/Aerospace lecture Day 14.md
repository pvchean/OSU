As mach number goes up, compressability also goes up.

Transition is a point (region) where laminar flow becomes turbulent.
1)$Re_{cr} = \frac{\rho_{\infty}V_{\infty}x_{cr}}{\mu}$

The physical meaning of Re = $\frac{\text{inertial force}}{\text{viscous force}}$
Re = Reynolds number

If Re is small, the viscous force is more dominant, which means the flow is being restricted.

Small $Re$: Viscous dominant -> particle held by viscosity -> laminar
Large $Re$: Inertial dominant -> particle not held by viscosity -> turbulent

$Re_{cr}$, Reynolds number (critical), depends on:
- Shape
- heat transfer
- surface roughness
- free stream turbulence

### Flow Separation
There is separation when $\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{\gamma}})_{y=0} = 0$
The flow becomes reversed and starts moving  backward.

if $\frac{\partial{\rho}}{\partial{x}}>0$, bad situation. Adverse pressure gradient.
if $\frac{\partial{\rho}}{\partial{x}}<0$, good situation. Favorable pressure gradient.
- $\frac{\partial{\rho}}{\partial{x}}$ depends on the shape of the airfoil/object.

As we change the angle of attack from $0 \degree \text{ to } \theta \degree$, the flow will start to separate, reverse flow will occur, and a significant reduction of lift will occur. we call this phenomena **stall**.

In a stall:
- eddies form in "dead" region.
- eddies sucks up all the energy -> P
- high mixing -> uniform P
- P plateau.

Laminar:
- Less Momentum to overcome $\frac{\partial{\rho}}{\partial{x}}$
- Easier Separation

Turbulent:
- More Momentum to overcome $\frac{\partial{\rho}}{\partial{x}}$
- Harder Separation, remains attached
$D_{total} = D_{friction} + D_{pressure}$
Avoid Separation!!!
