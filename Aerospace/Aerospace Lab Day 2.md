D = 1/2 ρ V$_∞$$^2$ S C$_D$
Where:
* ρ = density of fluid
* V = velocity
* S = Surface Area
* C$_D$ = Coefficient of Drag

Lab #2:
* 20 foot drop.
* egg is assumed to have a 60 g weight.
* C$_D$ Is assumed to be 1.0

Research shows:
* maximum speed of egg can be 2.6m/s
* ρ = 1.293 kg/m$^3$ = 1.293 x 10<sup>-3</sup> g/cm$^3$

Terminal Velocity

W = D = 1/2 ρ V$_∞$$^2$ S C$_D$

60 g = 1/2 (0.001293 g/cm$^3$) (2.0)$^2$ S 1.0
