Δg = Cv dt
where Cv = specific heat at constant volume

Cv = energy to raise temp of 1kg by 1k w/ const vol heating.


                                                                                                          

### Constant Volume
sg = C$_v$ dT
C$_v$ = specific heat at constant volume

sg = de + $\cancel{pdv}$ 
∫de = sg = Cv∫dT
e = C$_v$T


### Const Pressure
sg = Cp dT
Cp = specific heat at const pressure

sg = dh - $\cancel{vdp}$
∫dh = sh = C$_p$∫dt
h = C$_p$ T

### Isotropic Flow
The entropy of the flow does not change
Entropy is a measure of chaos. ie turbulence
Only happens if a process has no heat or  friction.
ie, inviscid flow when flying a plane, no heater  and no viscosity=no friction.


$\frac{P_{2}}{P_{1}} = (\frac{\rho_{2}}{\rho_{1}})^{r}= (\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}})^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}}$ 
$\gamma = \frac{C_{P}}{C_{V}} = \frac{Vdp}{-Pdv}$ 

$C_{p}T_{1} + \frac{1}{2}V_{1}^{2} = C_{p}T_{2}+ \frac{1}{2}V_{2}^{2}$
for isotropic and inviscid flow

**Speed of pressure** (perturbation) waves: a = $\sqrt{rRT}$
known as gas constant?

Mach #:
M = $\frac{V}{a} = \frac{V}{\sqrt{rRt}}$
