### Definitions:
- **Continuity**: nothing is created or destroyed. e.g. mass, energy
### Basic Aerodynamics
- efs used to predict $\rho$, P, V, T of flow
- Based on 3 principles of conservation:
	- Mass
	- Momentum
	- Energy
- 2 parts:
	- inviscid and viscous
- **inviscid**:
	- Most of the air far from the A/C  is inviscid.

### Compressible vs Incompressible Flow
**Incompressible**: $\rho$ (density) is constant.
**Compressible**: $\rho$ can change.

- All flows are compressible at all speeds.
- Incompressible flow is approx., for low speeds, M$_{\text{for mach}}$ < 0.3, air < 100 $\frac{m}{s}$, < 300 $\frac{ft}{s}$

### Bernoulli's equation

$\rho_{1}V_{1}A_{1} = \rho_{2}V_{2}A_{2}$ 
- For incompressible flow, where $\rho_{1}=\rho_2$, the formula can be simplified into:
  $V_{1}A_{1} = V_{2}A_{2}$ 
In general: 
	V↑ as A↓ ( for M<1 )
	V ↓as A↑ ( for M>1 )
