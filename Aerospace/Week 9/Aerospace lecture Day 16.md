Symmetric Airfoils have zero lift at zero angle of attack.

$C_{m}$: Coefficient of Moment

A flap increases the camber of an aifoil, pushing the $C_{l}\text{ vs. }\alpha$ line to the left, pushing the zero lift AoA towards the negative.

Cp = $\frac{P-P_{\infty}}{\frac{1}{2}\rho_{\infty}V_{\infty}^{2}} = \frac{P-P_{\infty}}{q_{\infty}}$

Incompressible:
$P_{0} = P_{\infty} + q_{\infty}$
$C_{p,LE} = \frac{P_{0}-P_{\infty}}{q_{\infty}} = \frac{q_{\infty}}{q_{\infty}} = 1$

Pvandtl Glaunt Correction:
$C_{l} = \frac{C_{p,0}}{\sqrt{1-M_{\infty}^{2}}}$

Area of shape in Cp vs x/c is the total lift.


aspect ratio: AR = $\frac{b}{c}\left(\frac{b}{b}\right) = \frac{b^{2}}{S}$

**Coefficient Notation:**
lower case subscript for airfoil: $C_{l},\ C_{d}$
Upper case subscript for wing: $C_{L}, C_{D}$

Finite Wing (3D) vs Infinite wing (2D)
Finite wing is real world wing, where there is a limited size and a tip of the wing.
Infinite wing is the cross section of an airfoil, where no wing tip is present, and behaves like a wing of infinite length.
