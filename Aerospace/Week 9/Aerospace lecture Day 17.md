$\alpha_{\text{eff}} = \alpha_{\text{geometric}} - \alpha_{\text{induced}}$
Tilted $\overrightarrow{L} \rightarrow \text{Generates Induced Drag }(D_{i})$ 
$D_{i} = L\sin{\alpha_{i}} \approx L \alpha_{i}$
small $\sin{\alpha_i} \approx \alpha_{i}$

#### Wing Lift Distribution and wing tip vortices
![[Pasted image 20241017092534.png]]
$\alpha_{i}\ \ \ \ \ \ \alpha w = f(L)$
where w is the **vortex strength**

L(y) is the lift distribution on the wing.
L(y) is affected by:
1) Chord: c(y)
2) twist: $\alpha$(y)
3) airfoil shape: (y)
Note: 2 & 3 are fixed, and create $c_{l}(y)$

An **Eliptical Wing** has uniform w(y), ie a uniform down wash.
$\alpha_{i} = \frac{C_{L}}{\pi AR}$  => if the wing has zero lift => $C_{L} = 0 \rightarrow d_{i} = 0 \rightarrow \alpha_{L=0} = \alpha_{eff, L=0}$

Large aspect ratio, means less angle-of-attack_induced, thus less wing tip vorices, thus more efficient

$D_{i} = L \frac{C_{l}}{\pi AR}$
$\frac{1}{q_{\infty}S}[D_{i} = L \frac{C_{l}}{\pi AR}]$
$C_{D_{i}} = \frac{C_{L}^{2}}{\pi AR}$ <- Elliptic Wing ONLY

For Non Elliptical Wings:
$C_{D_{i}} = \frac{C_{L}^{2}}{\pi AR\ e}$
where $e$ is the **Span Efficiency Factor**, a value $0.85 < e < 0.95$

$C_{D} = c_{d} + \frac{C_{L}^{2}}{\pi AR\ e}$
Where:
- $C_{D}$ = Total Drag
- $C_d$ = profile = friction + pressure
- $\frac{C_{L}^{2}}{\pi ARe}$ = induced drag

Radians: $d_{i} = \frac{C_{L}}{\pi AR\ e_{i}}$
Degrees: $d_{i} = \frac{57.3C_{L}}{\pi AR\ e_{i}}$

$C_{L}(\alpha) = C_{l}(\alpha_\text{eff})$, where $\alpha_\text{eff} = \alpha - \alpha_{i}$
$a_{0} > a$
$a = \frac{a_{0}}{1 + \frac{57.3a_{0}}{\pi AR\ e_l}}$

all this to find $C_{L}$ from $C_{l}$ ie 2d wing to 3d wing calculations.
