As a propeller A/C increases in velocity, the thrust available goes down because the propeller has to spin slower in order to not reach supersonic  velocity. The mach numbers would stall the propeller as Bernoulli principle inverts.

The local Minimum for $T_{R}$ is the optimal cruising speed of the aircraft.

### Power Required for steady flight
Work = Force  \* distance
Power = Work  per unit time.
$P = \frac{Thrust \times Distance}{Time} = TV$ 
$P_{R} = T_{R}V$ from A/C
$P_{A} = T_{A}V$ from engine

1$(D_{0} + D_{i})$
$(\frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}S C_{D,0} + \frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}S C_{D,i})V$
	$C_{D,i} = \frac{C_{L}^{2}}{\pi\ AR\ e}$
	$C_{L} = 2\frac{\frac{W}{S}}{\rho V^{2}}$
1)$\left(\frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}SC_{D,0}\right)V^{3} + \left(\frac{2W^{2}}{\pi\ AR\ e\rho s}\right)V^{-1}$
Where the left side is $P_{R,0\text{ lift}}$ and $P_{R,i}$ is lift dependant

$(P_{R})_{min}$ When $C_{D,0} = \frac{1}{3}C_{Di}$
$(T_{R})_{min}$ When $C_{D,0} = C_{Di}$

### 6.6) Power Available and $V_{Max}$ 
$P_{A} = n \times \text{SHP}$
Where SHP = Shaft Horse Power
n = % power transmitted to the air.
