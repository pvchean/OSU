h$_G$: Height from Ground
h$_A$: Height from Center of Earth

For the gravitational force between two objects,
F = $\frac{GMm}{d^{2}}$
$\left(\text{M}\right)$<---d-->\[m]

### Temperature at different heights
Troposphere: temperature decreases as altitude increases.
Stratosphere: temperature is  constant across altitudes.
Ionosphere: temperature increases as altitude increases.
Exosphere: temperature decreases, remains constant, then increases as altitude increases.

### Hydrostatic
It is measured by measuring an Area, A, and measuring the weight of air from that altitude up to the ceiling of the atmosphere
