## Homework
due on Mondays, three assignments posted  through out the week due next.

### Definitions
* **Mechanics**: Motion, or rest, of "bodies" under action of forces.
  - Rigid: Static and Dynamic
  - Deform-able: Mechanics of Materials
  - Fluids:
- **Bodies**: 2D or 3D "things" where we only care about the full object.
- **Particle**: A point where the orientation and changes inside the body aren't relevant.

**Fundamental Parameters**:
* Space, P(XYZ) ->
* Time, t
* Force, F(x,y,z) - vector and position 

For **RIGID** bodies, the 6 fundamental principles are:
1) Parallelogram law/adding forces
2) Transmissibility of F in the same plane
3) Newtons 1st Law: If the sum of forces adds to zero, the motion will not change.
4) Newtons 2nd Law: Sum of forces = M * Accelerations
5) Newtons 3rd Law: Each force has an equal and opposite reaction.
6) Newtons Law of Gravity: F = G (M1 * M2) / (r^2). G\*M / (r^2) = "g" where g is gravity in earth's surface.
SI has 3 foundational units: Meter, Seconds and kg

Forces should always  add up to zero.

### Just have a think
1 Slug = 1 Lb f / 1fr/s^2 
W = mg

g=9.81m/s^2 

W = (1 Slug)(332ln/slug)

### Sig Figs
4 for seconds
3 otherwise
