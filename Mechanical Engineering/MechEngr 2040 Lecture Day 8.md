Find the effective force + couple moment
means
ΣM$_0$ = M$_0$ 
ΣF$_x$ = F$_x$
ΣF$_y$ = F$_y$

### Equilibrium ( Last section for Midterm 1)
Newton's law says ΣF⃗=0 for equilibrium
2D:
	ΣF$_x$ = 0
	ΣF$_y$ = 0

3D:
	ΣF$_x$ = 0
	ΣF$_y$ = 0
	ΣF$_z$ = 0

If all forces don't end up at the same point:
2D:
	ΣM$_{\text{point}}$ = 0

3D:
	ΣM$_x$ = 0
	ΣM$_y$ = 0
	ΣM$_z$ = 0
### Drawing Free Body Diagrams
1) Remove all Supports
2) Replace each support with what it does to the object
3) Don't forget the weight
