## More Units
### Kilo-Pound (Kip/Kips)
A thousand pounds
### Force
A force is a type of vector made of the following:
1) Point of Application
2) Line of Application (Direction)
3) Magnitude
Forces are positional vectors because they are bound  to where that point of application is.
Forces can have equal vectors, but if the PoA is not the same, the vectors aren't equal.
### Vector
Have magnitude and direction.
### Scalar
Only have magnitude.

## Particles with two forces
P: 45 deg
Q: 315 deg
We can add both forces into a single resultant force, R, through the use of the parallelogram rule.
R: 0 deg
