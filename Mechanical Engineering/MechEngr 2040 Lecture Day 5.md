### Moments!
Moment M⃗ measured the tenancy of force F⃗ to  make a rigid body rotate about some fixed axis through 0

### Simplest Example:
F⃗ ⟂ r⃗$_{oa}$
F⃗$_2$ along r⃗$_{oa}$ 
M$_{o1}$ = F$_{1}$d ↺
M$_{o2}$ = 0
- Unit moment (like torque) Nm,  ft*lb
- A positive torque rotates counter clockwise on the x (->) y (↑) plane. Use right hand rule depending on vector orientation.
- The shape of the object doesnt matter!
- The object can be static! ie not rotating, wont rotate
- You can directly add moments together if they share the same origin
  $\Sigma M_{o} < (M_{r})_{0} = F_{1}d_{1} - F_{2}d_{2}$
  r = residual
r⃗ is the position vector from O, the origin, to the Point of Application (POA) of the force vector.
### Principles of Moments
Use F⃗ components and "sliding" forces along LOA

#### Example
- Assume F⃗ = $F_{X}$i⃗ + F$_y$j⃗ applied at A(x,y) away from O.
