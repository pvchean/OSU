A curved rod will break when M$_e$ = 80 lb * ft


#### Dot vs Cross
- A dot product is used to find a component of a vector in a specific direction.
  ie if F = 10i + 30j -7k, for u⃗ is along the x-axis, u⃗ = F * u = F * i = 10
  * it is also used to find the angles between two vectors.
    v⃗ * w⃗ = |u⃗| * |w⃗| cos $\theta$, u$_v$ * u$_w$ = cos $\theta$ 
* cross product is used to find a vector perpendicular to two vectors.

Magnitude of cross product is the area of the parallelogram
### Finding a moment about an axis
